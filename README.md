# React Native Third-Party Library Integration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky issue in React Native development: integrating third-party libraries effectively.  The example shows a scenario where a library isn't properly set up, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution focuses on ensuring proper installation and configuration, including handling potential version conflicts.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-native-third-party-error`
3. Install the necessary packages: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`)

## Problem
