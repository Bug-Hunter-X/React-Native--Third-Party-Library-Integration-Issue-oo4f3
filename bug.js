This error occurs when using a third-party library that has not been properly integrated into your React Native project.  It can manifest in various ways, such as unexpected behavior, crashes, or build errors.  The root cause often lies in missing dependencies, incorrect configuration, or incompatibility between the library and your React Native version.

```javascript
// Example: Using a library that's not properly installed
import AwesomeLibrary from 'awesome-library';

// ... later in the code
<AwesomeLibrary someProp="value" />
```
