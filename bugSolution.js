To solve this, you need to ensure the library is properly installed and linked. This often involves following the library's specific installation instructions and confirming compatibility with your React Native version.

1. **Verify Installation:** Double-check that you've installed the library using the correct method (npm or yarn). 
2. **Check for Linking:** Many libraries require linking to your native iOS/Android code.  Consult the library's documentation for the specific linking instructions.
3. **Version Compatibility:** Ensure the library is compatible with your current React Native version.  Check the library's package.json for version information and compatibility notes.
4. **Review Dependencies:** Check that all dependencies of the library are correctly installed. 
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve integration issues. Try cleaning your build cache and rebuilding your project.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// Correct installation and linkage assumed
import AwesomeLibrary from 'awesome-library';

// ... later in the code
<AwesomeLibrary someProp="value" />
```
